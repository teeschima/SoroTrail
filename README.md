# SoroTrail

A contract event indexer for the Stellar/Soroban network.

Stellar RPC's `getEvents` method only retains contract events for roughly 24
hours to 7 days. Anyone who needs historical Soroban event data — dapp
dashboards, analytics, audits, notification services — must ingest and store
events themselves before the RPC drops them.

SoroTrail does exactly that: it polls a Stellar RPC endpoint, stores contract
events durably in Postgres, and serves them back through a queryable HTTP API
long after the RPC has forgotten them.

```

## Quickstart

### Published image (fastest)

Tagged releases publish a multi-arch (amd64/arm64) image to GHCR. Point it at
a Postgres you already have:

```sh
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -e DATABASE_URL='postgres://user:pass@host:5432/sorotrail?sslmode=disable' \
  -e RPC_URL='https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org' \
  ghcr.io/sorotrail/sorotrail:latest
```

Pin a specific release with a version tag instead of `latest`, e.g.
`ghcr.io/sorotrail/sorotrail:v1.2.0`. See [Configuration](#configuration) for
the full list of environment variables.

### Docker Compose (full stack)

Brings up Postgres and the indexer together — no external database required:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

This starts Postgres and the indexer against the public Stellar testnet RPC.
The API is on http://localhost:8080; watch the logs to see events flow in.

To watch specific contracts instead of everything:

```sh
WATCHED_CONTRACTS=CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC docker compose up --build
```

**Container health.** The published image ships with a `HEALTHCHECK` that
probes `/health` via the in-binary `sorotrail healthcheck` subcommand
(alpine has no curl/wget — installing curl or shipping a second binary
would just grow the image; routing the probe through the existing
binary reuses the `net/http` client that's already linked in for the
server, so the cost is a few hundred bytes of flag-parsing and a probe
function). Compose mirrors the same probe so `docker ps` shows an
honest health status, and combined with `depends_on: condition:
service_healthy` on Postgres, a fresh `docker compose up --build`
brings the stack up in the right order instead of hoping the indexer
wins a race against a half-up database.

### Bare metal

```sh
docker compose up -d postgres     # or bring your own Postgres
cp .env.example .env              # adjust as needed
set -a; source .env; set +a
make run
```

Migrations run automatically on startup.

## Configuration

All configuration comes from environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RPC_URL` | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` | Stellar RPC endpoint (JSON-RPC 2.0). Point at a provider URL for mainnet. |
| `HORIZON_URL` | `https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org` | Stellar Horizon REST endpoint used by `sorotrail backfill` only. Live ingestion does not touch Horizon. |
| `BACKFILL_RATE_RPS` | `10` | Pace against Horizon when backfilling. 10 req/s is the public-instance cap; private deployments can lift this. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | — (required) | Postgres connection string. |
| `POLL_INTERVAL` | `5s` | Sleep between polls once caught up. |
| `HTTP_ADDR` | `:8080` | API listen address. |
| `WATCHED_CONTRACTS` | empty | Comma-separated contract IDs (`C...`). Empty = ingest **all** contract events. |
| `START_LEDGER` | unset | Force cold-start ingestion from this ledger. |
| `RETENTION_LEDGERS` | `17280` | Cold-start reach-back in ledgers (~24h at 5s/ledger). |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug` \| `info` \| `warn` \| `error`. |
| `LOG_FORMAT` | `text` | `text` \| `json`. JSON emits one JSON object per line, compatible with Loki, CloudWatch, and ELK. |
| `API_QUERY_TIMEOUT` | `25s` | Per-request database timeout for API-originated store reads. The timeout is enforced in-process and mirrored to Postgres via `statement_timeout`. |
| `API_SLOW_QUERY_THRESHOLD` | `2s` | Warn when an API-originated store query takes longer than this threshold; logs include the query name and elapsed duration. |
| `AUDIT_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable the background auditor. When unset/false the binary behaves exactly like the pre-audit build. |
| `AUDIT_POLL_INTERVAL` | `30s` | Sleep between audit passes. |
| `AUDIT_BATCH_LEDGERS` | `100` | Ledger range covered by one audit pass. |
| `AUDIT_LAG_THRESHOLD` | `200` | Auditor sleeps until ingest is at least this many ledgers past the verified mark. |
| `AUDIT_BUDGET_SHARE` | `0.10` | Fraction of the request budget the audit pool gets (rest goes to ingest). |
| `AUDIT_MAX_RPS` | `10` | Total request budget (split between ingest and audit). |
| `AUDIT_MAX_REPAIR_ATTEMPTS` | `3` | Repair iterations before a finding is kept open as `unrecoverable`. |
| `AUDIT_FINDING_MAX_LEDGERS` | `100` | Largest range a single finding is allowed to span. |
| `API_MAX_LIMIT` | `500` | Maximum page size accepted for list endpoints (`/events`, `/subscriptions/{id}/deliveries`). Values above this are rejected with 400. |
| `RATE_LIMIT_RPS` | unset | Per-client HTTP request rate limit (`requests/second`). Both `RATE_LIMIT_RPS` and `RATE_LIMIT_BURST` must be set together; otherwise no rate limiting is applied. |
| `RATE_LIMIT_BURST` | unset | Maximum instantaneous burst size for the rate limiter. Pairs with `RATE_LIMIT_RPS`. |
| `RATE_LIMIT_TRUSTED_PROXY` | `false` | Honor `X-Forwarded-For` for client IP detection. Must only be enabled behind a proxy you trust to strip/rewrite the header — clients control `X-Forwarded-For` themselves, so enabling it on an Internet-facing surface lets any caller pick their own rate-limit key. |
| `CACHE_PRIVATE` | `false` | Flip cacheable responses from `Cache-Control: public` to `private`. Set this when the deployment serves per-user data behind an auth layer (see [Caching](#caching)). |
| `RATE_LIMIT_RPS` | unset | Per-client HTTP request rate limit (`requests/second`). Both `RATE_LIMIT_RPS` and `RATE_LIMIT_BURST` must be set together; otherwise no rate limiting is applied. |
| `RATE_LIMIT_BURST` | unset | Maximum instantaneous burst size for the rate limiter. Pairs with `RATE_LIMIT_RPS`. |
| `RATE_LIMIT_TRUSTED_PROXY` | `false` | Honor `X-Forwarded-For` for client IP detection. Must only be enabled behind a proxy you trust to strip/rewrite the header — clients control `X-Forwarded-For` themselves, so enabling it on an Internet-facing surface lets any caller pick their own rate-limit key. |
| `COMPRESS_MIN_SIZE` | `1400` | Response body size (bytes) at or above which responses are gzip/deflate encoded for clients advertising support. Set negative to disable compression. See [Compression](#compression). |
| `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | `15s` | Time the graceful shutdown may wait for in-flight requests and the current ingest cycle to wind down before the process is killed. Zero means wait indefinitely. |
| `SWEEP_CONCURRENCY` | `1` | Number of filter batches fanned out in parallel during a windowSweep pass. The per-request RPC interval limiter still caps total request rate at ~10 req/s, so raising this helps only against private RPCs with more headroom. The single-batch path (`<=25` watched contracts) is unchanged. |
| `REORG_CONFIRMATION_WINDOW` | `64` | Number of ledgers behind the ingest frontier re-scanned on a schedule for RPC-side reorgs. Once a ledger is further behind the frontier than this, it is considered finalized and never rewritten. Zero disables reorg detection. |
| `REORG_RESCAN_INTERVAL` | `1m` | Cadence of the periodic reorg re-scan over the recent finalized window. The re-scan shares the live RPC budget and runs after a successful ingest cycle. |
| `EXPORT_MAX_RANGE` | `17280` | Maximum ledger span a single `/contracts/{id}/export` call may request (~24h at 5s/ledger). Returns `400` with the bound if exceeded. Raise for dedicated analytical deployments; lower for tighter abuse thresholds. |
| `MULTI_TENANT` | `false` | Serve several consumers from one deployment, each scoped to its own contracts. Off means no authentication and no tenant boundary — identical to the pre-multi-tenancy build. See [Multi-tenancy](docs/multi-tenancy.md). |
| `MULTI_TENANT_MAX_WATCHED` | `250` | Cap on the union of all tenants' watch lists, bounding the ingester's RPC cost. `0` disables the cap. |
| `MULTI_TENANT_USAGE_FLUSH` | `10s` | How often accumulated per-tenant usage counters are persisted. |
| `MULTI_TENANT_STREAM_SCOPE_SYNC` | `30s` | How often an open stream re-resolves its tenant's grants, bounding how long a revoked grant keeps being served. |
| `MULTI_TENANT_BOOTSTRAP_KEY` | unset | Installs an admin API key for the seeded `default` tenant at startup, so a fresh multi-tenant install can mint its first keys. Rejected unless `MULTI_TENANT=true`. |

## Ingestion behavior

- **Cold start** (empty database): begins at `latest ledger − RETENTION_LEDGERS`
  (clamped to what the RPC still retains) so it captures as much recent history
  as possible, then follows the chain head. `START_LEDGER` overrides this.
- **Warm start**: resumes from the persisted cursor / last ingested ledger.
- Events are upserted idempotently by ID, so re-scans and restarts never
  duplicate rows.
- If the indexer is down long enough that its resume point falls out of the
  RPC's retention window, it logs a warning and skips ahead to the oldest
  retained ledger (the gap is unrecoverable from RPC — that's the problem this
  project exists to prevent).
- Requests are rate-limited (~10/s, matching public endpoint limits) and
  errors are retried with jittered exponential backoff.
- **Ingest-lag alarm**: every poll cycle compares the chain head (fetched via
  `getLatestLedger`) to the last ingested ledger. When the gap exceeds
  `LAG_WARN_LEDGERS` (default `100`), a single WARN-level structured log is
  emitted; a single INFO log fires when the gap closes. Hysteresis keeps the
  alarm quiet between crossings, so a stuck indexer logs once on crossing
  and once on recovery rather than spamming. No log is emitted on cold
  start (no baseline yet) or when the alarm is disabled
  (`LAG_WARN_LEDGERS=0`).
- Topics/values are stored as JSON. When the RPC supports `xdrFormat: "json"`
  its decoding is used verbatim; otherwise the base64 XDR is decoded locally
  into shapes like `{"symbol":"transfer"}`, `{"u64":42}`, `{"i128":"-1000"}`,
  `{"address":"C..."}`.
- The raw base64 XDR is stored alongside the decoded JSON, so an improved
  decoder can be applied to already-indexed events — see
  [decoder replay](#decoder-replay). This intentionally duplicates payload
  data in `events.topics_xdr` and `events.value_xdr`; budget extra event-table
  storage for deployments that retain large event histories.

## Backfilling historical events

SoroTrail's live ingester only reaches as far back as the Stellar RPC's
retention window (typically 24h on the public testnet, up to a couple
weeks on private deployments). For contracts whose history you care
about, this leaves a permanent blind spot.

`sorotrail backfill` closes that gap by walking `/accounts/{contract_id}/transactions`
on a Horizon deployment that retains historical transaction meta,
decoding each `result_meta_xdr` through the standard pipeline so
backfilled rows are indistinguishable from live-ingested ones
(including raw XDR for replay).

```sh
# First-pass dry run to see what would be written
sorotrail backfill \
  --contract CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC \
  --from-ledger 1 --to-ledger 250000 --dry-run

# Then commit it
sorotrail backfill \
  --contract CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC \
  --from-ledger 1 --to-ledger 250000
```

It is batched, resumable (Ctrl-C and re-run picks up where it stopped),
idempotent (re-runs write nothing once finished), and safe alongside
live ingestion. A single-row `backfill_state` table holds progress so
resume works across restarts; idempotent upserts make the resume
overlap harmless.

Source limitations are spelled out in [docs/backfill.md](docs/backfill.md) —
notably: Horizon must retain historical meta for the target network,
only Soroban V3/V4 transactions carry events, and the public Stellar
testnet Horizon retains everything from protocol 17 onward while
mainnet varies.

## Decoder replay

Decoders improve over time. `sorotrail replay` re-runs the current decoder
over stored raw XDR and rewrites the decoded columns, so improvements apply
to everything already indexed instead of only to future events.

```sh
sorotrail replay --from-ledger 250000 --dry-run   # see what would change
sorotrail replay --from-ledger 250000             # rewrite it
```

It is batched, resumable (Ctrl-C and re-run picks up where it stopped),
idempotent, and safe to run against a live database while ingestion
continues; a Postgres advisory lock prevents two replays at once.

See [docs/replay.md](docs/replay.md) for flags, the summary output, the
advisory-lock strategy, and the derivation order for dependent tables.

## Compression

Responses are gzip- or deflate-encoded when the client advertises support via
`Accept-Encoding`, which matters most for event listings — a 200-event page is
largely repetitive JSON keys and compresses well.

Compression is applied per response, not per route, and only once the body
reaches `COMPRESS_MIN_SIZE` (1400 bytes by default — roughly one Ethernet
MTU). Below that, encoding costs CPU on both ends and can make the body
*larger* once the gzip header and trailer are counted, so small responses
(error envelopes, `/health`, a single event) are sent as-is.

Clients that don't advertise an encoding get the original bytes, byte for
byte. `gzip` is preferred over `deflate` when both are offered, and
`gzip;q=0` is honored as a refusal rather than a low ranking.

Some things are deliberately left alone:

- **WebSocket upgrades** (`/events/ws`) bypass the middleware entirely — the
  response is a `101` and the connection is then taken over.
- **Streaming responses** that flush before reaching the threshold give up on
  compression rather than holding bytes back, so a live stream never stalls
  waiting for a buffer to fill.
- **`204` and `304`** carry no body, and a `304` with `Content-Encoding`
  misleads caches.
- **Non-compressible media types** (images, already-compressed payloads) and
  bodies a handler already encoded itself.

`Vary: Accept-Encoding` is always set, so a shared cache never serves a
compressed body to a client that can't decode it. Compressing produces a
different representation of the same resource, so a strong `ETag` is weakened
(`"v1"` → `W/"v1"`) when a response is encoded; conditional requests still
match, since `If-None-Match` comparison ignores the `W/` prefix.

## API reference

All responses are JSON. Errors look like `{"error": "message"}`.

### Pagination

Every list endpoint uses cursor-based pagination with a consistent contract:

- **Request parameters**: `?cursor=<opaque>&limit=<int>` (both optional)
- **Response envelope**: each list response includes a `"cursor"` field.
  When non-empty, more results exist — pass it back as `?cursor=` for
  the next page. When empty or omitted, the result set is exhausted.
- **Cursor format**: the cursor is the last row's sort-key value
  (typically an event ID or integer primary key). It is opaque —
  clients must never inspect or modify it. Sending an invalid cursor
  returns `400 Bad Request` with the standard error envelope
  `{"error": "invalid cursor ..."}`.
- **Defaults**: `limit` defaults to 50 when unset; the maximum is 500
  (configurable via `API_MAX_LIMIT`).
  Values outside `[1, API_MAX_LIMIT]` return `400 Bad Request`.
- **Empty result sets** return an empty array with no `"cursor"` field
  (or an empty string cursor, depending on the endpoint).

```sh
# First page
curl -s 'localhost:8080/events?limit=10'
# {"events":[...],"cursor":"0001099511627776-0000000009"}

# Next page using the cursor from the previous response
curl -s 'localhost:8080/events?cursor=0001099511627776-0000000009&limit=10'
```

### `GET /health`

Reports the API's view of its dependencies. `200` when both the database and
the RPC are reachable and healthy, `503` otherwise.

```sh
curl -s localhost:8080/health
```

```json
{"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","rpc":"ok"}}
```

### `GET /events`

Lists stored events in ascending (oldest-first) or descending (newest-first) order. Defaults to ascending.

Query parameters (all optional, combinable):

| Param | Example | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contract_id` | `C1&contract_id=C2` | Events for any of the listed contracts. Use repeated `contract_id` params; comma-separated lists are rejected. |
| `type` | `contract&type=system` | Events for any of the listed types. Use repeated `type` params; comma-separated lists are rejected. |
| `topic` | `{"symbol":"transfer"}` | Exact match against any topic position. A bare word is treated as a JSON string. |
| `topic_contains` | `[{"address":"G..."}]` | Postgres jsonb containment (`@>`) against the topics array. Pass an array to match one or more topic elements: `[{"address":"G..."}]` matches any event where a topic contains that address; `[{"symbol":"transfer"},{"address":"G..."}]` requires both. Must be parseable JSON (400 otherwise). Uses the GIN index on `topics`. |
| `topic0` | `{"symbol":"transfer"}` | Exact match against topic position 0. |
| `topic1` | `{"address":"G..."}` | Exact match against topic position 1. |
| `topic2` | `{"address":"G..."}` | Exact match against topic position 2. |
| `topic3` | `{"u64":7}` | Exact match against topic position 3. |
| `tx_hash` | `9f5c...` | Only events from this transaction hash. |
| `in_successful_call` | `true` | `true` \| `false`; filters by whether the enclosing call succeeded. Omitted — no constraint. |
| `from_ledger` | `250000` | Inclusive lower ledger bound. |
| `to_ledger` | `260000` | Inclusive upper ledger bound. |
| `from_time` | `2026-07-21T00:00:00Z` | Inclusive lower `created_at` bound (RFC 3339). Sub-second precision and missing timezone are rejected. |
| `to_time` | `2026-07-22T00:00:00Z` | Inclusive upper `created_at` bound (RFC 3339). Sub-second precision and missing timezone are rejected. |
| `limit` | `50` | Page size, 1–500 (default 50). Configurable max via `API_MAX_LIMIT`. |
| `cursor` | `0001234...` | Opaque pagination cursor from a previous response. |
| `order` | `desc` | `asc` \| `desc`, defaults to asc. Sort direction. |
| `order_by` | `created_at` | `id` \| `ledger` \| `created_at`, defaults to `id`. Sort column. Anything else is a `400`. |
| `decoded` | `true` | When `true`, enriches events with spec-driven named fields. Contracts without a spec return flagged raw data with `"decoded": false`. |
| `include_xdr` | `true` | When `true`, includes raw base64 `topics_xdr` and `value_xdr` on each event. Omitted by default to keep responses small. |

Topic filters may use `topic` for any-position matching, or `topic0`..`topic3` for position-specific matching. `topic` and positional topic filters cannot be combined.

#### Ordering and pagination

`order_by` picks the sort column and `order` the direction, so they combine:

```sh
curl -s 'localhost:8080/events?order_by=created_at&order=desc&limit=100'
```

Pagination stays correct under every ordering. `ledger` and `created_at` both
have duplicates — a ledger holds many events, and a batch insert stamps one
`created_at` on all of them — so those orderings sort by `(column, id)` and
their cursors carry both halves. That keeps a page boundary landing in the
middle of a run of equal values from skipping or repeating rows.

Cursors are opaque and tied to the ordering that produced them: feeding a
cursor from one `order_by` into another returns `400`. Always pass back the
`cursor` from the previous response with the same `order_by`/`order`. Cursors
issued for the default `id` ordering are unchanged, so existing clients keep
working.

```sh
curl -s 'localhost:8080/events?contract_id=CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC&topic={"symbol":"transfer"}&limit=2'

```sh
curl -s 'localhost:8080/events?contract_id=CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC&contract_id=CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&type=contract&type=system&limit=2'
```
```

Containment search (`topic_contains`) lets you filter by partial topic
structure — e.g. any event involving a specific address, even when you
don't know the full topic shape:

```sh
# Events whose topics include a specific address
curl -s 'localhost:8080/events?topic_contains=[{"address":"GA...5WI"}]&limit=5'
# Events with both a transfer symbol and a specific address
curl -s 'localhost:8080/events?topic_contains=[{"symbol":"transfer"},{"address":"GA...5WI"}]&limit=5'
```

**Semantics**: `topic_contains` uses Postgres jsonb containment (`@>`),
not substring matching. `topic_contains=[{"address":"G..."}]` means
"the topics array contains an element that itself jsonb-contains
`{"address":"G..."}`", so `{"address":"G...","symbol":"transfer"}`
matches. For exact element equality use `topic` instead.

```sh
curl -s 'localhost:8080/events?topic0={"symbol":"transfer"}&topic1={"address":"GABC..."}&topic2={"address":"GDEF..."}'
```

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "0001099511627776-0000000001",
      "contract_id": "CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC",
      "ledger": 256000,
      "type": "contract",
      "tx_hash": "9f5c...",
      "tx_index": 1,
      "op_index": 0,
      "in_successful_call": true,
      "topics": [{"symbol":"transfer"},{"address":"G..."},{"address":"G..."}],
      "value": {"i128":"10000000"},
      "created_at": "2026-07-16T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "cursor": "0001099511627776-0000000001"
}
```

`cursor` is present when more results exist; pass it back as `?cursor=` for
the next page.

When `include_xdr=true`, events also include the original base64 XDR payload:

```json
{
  "topics_xdr": ["AAAADwAAAAh0cmFuc2Zlcg=="],
  "value_xdr": "AAAACgAAAAAAAAAB"
}
```

Time filtering narrows results and does not change ordering (events remain in
ascending event-ID order, which agrees with `created_at` order because both
follow ledger sequence).

```sh
curl -s 'localhost:8080/events?from_time=2026-07-21T14:00:00Z&to_time=2026-07-21T15:00:00Z'
```

### `GET /events/{id}`

Fetch a single event by its ID (the TOID-based identifier from the RPC).
`404` if unknown.

```sh
curl -s localhost:8080/events/0001099511627776-0000000001
```

### `GET /contracts/{id}/events`

Convenience wrapper for `GET /events?contract_id={id}`; accepts the same
remaining query parameters. It rejects an explicit `contract_id` query
parameter to avoid conflicting filters.

```sh
curl -s localhost:8080/contracts/CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC/events?limit=10
```

### `GET /contracts/{id}/export`

Streams a contract's stored events for a closed ledger range as an
`attachment` download. Either `csv` (default) or `ndjson` is supported
via `?format=csv|ndjson`. Ledger bounds are required; ranges larger
than `EXPORT_MAX_RANGE` (default `17280` ledgers, roughly 24h) return
`400` with the bound included in the error.

```sh
# CSV — id, ledger, type, tx_hash, topics (JSON string), value (JSON string)
curl -OJ 'localhost:8080/contracts/CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC/export?from_ledger=250000&to_ledger=260000'

# NDJSON — one event object per line, same shape as /events
curl -OJ 'localhost:8080/contracts/CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC/export?from_ledger=250000&to_ledger=260000&format=ndjson'
```

The response carries
`Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="<id>-ledgers-<from>-<to>.<format>"`
so downloads land under intuitive file names, and `Cache-Control: no-store`
keeps stale browser caches from freezing a snapshot. The store is queried
in fixed-size pages (`200` rows, at the `MaxQueryLimit` ceiling), so
memory usage stays bounded regardless of the ledger span.

### Ingestion behavior additions

- **Parallel sweeps** (`SWEEP_CONCURRENCY`, default `1`): deployments
  watching more than the per-request 25 contracts split the filter set
  into multiple request chains paged through each `SweepWindow` ledger
  span. With the default the chains are still issued sequentially;
  raise `SWEEP_CONCURRENCY` against a private RPC to fan the chains
  out via bounded concurrency. The HTTPClient's interval limiter caps
  total request rate at ~10 req/s regardless, so the parallelism only
  helps when the RPC has headroom past the public ceiling. The
  single-batch path (`<=25` watched contracts) is unchanged.
- **Reorg detection** (`REORG_CONFIRMATION_WINDOW`, default `64`): after
  every successful ingest cycle the Run loop re-fetches the range
  `[frontier - REORG_CONFIRMATION_WINDOW, frontier - 1]` and replaces
  any drift via the auditor's transactional delete + insert repair
  (`ReplaceEventsInRange`). Rows past the window are treated as
  **finalized** and never rewritten — once a ledger stays more than
  `REORG_CONFIRMATION_WINDOW` behind the ingest frontier the re-scan
  can no longer mutate its rows. Set `REORG_CONFIRMATION_WINDOW=0` to
  disable the re-scan entirely.

### Graceful shutdown

A SIGINT or SIGTERM cancels the root context, which propagates into:

- The HTTP server: `Shutdown` holds open connections while they finish
  their current request, bounded by `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` (default `15s`).
- The ingester: `Run` lets the current `runOnce` cycle wind down to its
  next iteration boundary, then returns `context.Canceled`.
  `ingestion_state` is only advanced at the end of a successful cycle,
  so a cancelled cycle leaves the frontier at the last fully-persisted
  ledger; restart resumes from there with idempotent upserts covering
  any in-flight rows on the next pass.

This guarantees no panics and no truncated writes on `Ctrl-C` / `kill`,
and the cursor is always persisted so the next process picks up exactly
where the previous one stopped.

### GraphQL API

Read-only GraphQL endpoint at `POST /graphql`, schema-first with
Shared query-builder helpers in `internal/api/queries` so REST and
GraphQL validate filters identically. Same `EventFilter` shape,
same `Cursor` semantics, no drift between transports.

#### Endpoints

- **`POST /graphql`** — accepts a JSON body
  `{"query": "...", "variables": {...}, "operationName": "..."}`. Returns
  the standard GraphQL envelope `{"data": ..., "errors": ...}`.
- **`GET /graphql?query=...`** — same handler; useful for browser
  playground GET hits.
- **`GET /graphiql`** — dev-mode GraphiQL playground. Disabled by
  default; set `GRAPHQL_PLAYGROUND=true` to serve it.

#### Limits

To prevent abuse, every operation runs through two pre-flight checks
before any resolver runs:

- **Depth**: 10 (hard cap). Anything deeper is rejected with an
  `errors[].message` describing the violation.
- **Complexity**: 1000 (hard cap). Connection-style fields cost 25,
  leaf fields 1, plus a 5-unit operation overhead. Wide fanout sits
  comfortably within the cap; a pathological 100k-field request is
  rejected before SQL touches the events table.

Both limits are configurable in `internal/api/graphql/limits.go`.
Bumping them requires rebaselining against real client queries.

#### Schema highlights

Queries (read-only, no mutations):

- `events(filter: EventFilterInput, page: PageInput): EventConnection!`
- `tokenEvents(filter: EventFilterInput, page: PageInput): TokenEventConnection!`
- `contracts(page: PageInput): ContractConnection!`
- `event(id: ID!): Event` — single event lookup, null when missing.
- `contract(id: ID!): Contract` — single watched-contract lookup.

Filter input fields mirror the REST `GET /events` query parameters:

- `contractId`, `types[]`, `topic`, `topics.t0..t3`, `topicContains`,
  `txHash`, `fromLedger`/`toLedger`, `fromTime`/`toTime`.

Pagination input is Relay-style: `first`/`after` for forward,
`last`/`before` for backward (currently unsupported and rejected
with an error message — see `queries.ResolvePage`). Sort: `order`
+ `orderBy` (defaults ASC/id).

#### Example 1 — list events with filter + cursor pagination

```graphql
query EventsForContract($id: ID!, $first: Int!) {
  events(
    filter: { contractId: $id, type: CONTRACT }
    page: { first: $first, orderBy: LEDGER, order: ASC }
  ) {
    edges {
      cursor
      node { id contractId ledger type topics value createdAt }
    }
    nodes { id ledger createdAt }
    pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
    totalCount
  }
}
```

Variables:

```json
{
  "id": "CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC",
  "first": 10
}
```

Response (200 OK):

```json
{
  "data": {
    "events": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "cursor": "eyJpZCI6IjAwMDEwOTk1MTE2Mjc3NzYtMDAwMDAwMDAwMSIsIm9yZGVyX2J5IjoiaWQiLCJvcmRlciI6ImFzYyJ9",
          "node": {
            "id": "0001099511627776-0000000001",
            "contractId": "CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC",
            "ledger": 256000,
            "type": "contract",
            "topics": [{"symbol":"transfer"}, {"address":"G..."}],
            "value": {"i128":"10000000"},
            "createdAt": "2026-07-16T12:00:00Z"
          }
        }
      ],
      "nodes": [
        {
          "id": "0001099511627776-0000000001",
          "ledger": 256000,
          "createdAt": "2026-07-16T12:00:00Z"
        }
      ],
      "pageInfo": { "hasNextPage": true, "endCursor": "eyJpZCI6..." },
      "totalCount": 4321
    }
  }
}
```

Pass `endCursor` back as `page.after` to retrieve the next page.
Cursors are opaque — base64-JSON `{LastID, OrderBy, Order}` — so
clients should treat them as strings.

#### Example 2 — list token events with spec decoding

```graphql
query TokenEvents($id: ID!) {
  tokenEvents(
    filter: { contractId: $id, topic: "transfer", topicContains: [{"symbol":"transfer"}] }
    page: { first: 5, orderBy: LEDGER, order: DESC }
  ) {
    edges { cursor node { id ledger } }
    nodes {
      id
      decoded
      decodedEvent { name fields }
      topics
      value
    }
    pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
    totalCount
  }
}
```

Variables:

```json
{ "id": "CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC" }
```

Response (200 OK; `decodedEvent.fields` is only populated when
`decoded == true`):

```json
{
  "data": {
    "tokenEvents": {
      "edges": [{"cursor": "...", "node": {"id": "...", "ledger": 256100}}],
      "nodes": [
        {
          "id": "0001099511627776-0000000042",
          "decoded": true,
          "decodedEvent": {
            "name": "transfer",
            "fields": {"from": "G...", "to": "G...", "amount": "10000000"}
          },
          "topics": [{"symbol":"transfer"}, {"address":"G..."}, {"address":"G..."}],
          "value": {"i128":"10000000"}
        }
      ],
      "pageInfo": { "hasNextPage": false, "endCursor": null },
      "totalCount": 1
    }
  }
}
```

#### Filter + pagination parity with REST

Both transports share `internal/api/queries`: type whitelists, topic
positional rules, ledger/time bounds, cursor validation, page-size
caps are identical. A REST request rejected with `400 invalid cursor`
returns the same `errors[].message` from GraphQL. Conversely a
GraphQL topic/topic0 conflict returns the same `errors[].message` as
the REST `/events?topic=…&topic0=…` handler.


### Webhooks

Consumers can register callback URLs that receive matching events as they are
ingested. Delivery is asynchronous — it never blocks ingestion — and includes
HMAC-SHA256 signatures so subscribers can verify payload authenticity.

#### `POST /subscriptions`

Register a new webhook subscription.

```sh
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/subscriptions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com/webhook",
    "secret": "whsec_z8eP5qL3vR2xK9yB4w",
    "filters": {
      "contract_id": "CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC",
      "type": "contract",
      "topic": {"symbol":"transfer"}
    }
  }'
```

Response (`201 Created`):

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "url": "https://example.com/webhook",
  "filters": {
    "contract_id": "CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC",
    "type": "contract",
    "topic": {"symbol":"transfer"}
  },
  "secret": "whsec_z8eP5qL3vR2xK9yB4w",
  "enabled": true,
  "failure_count": 0,
  "created_at": "2026-07-24T12:00:00Z"
}
```

`filters` has the same shape as `GET /events` query parameters — an empty
object `{}` matches every event. `enabled` defaults to `true`.

#### `GET /subscriptions`

List all subscriptions.

```sh
curl -s localhost:8080/subscriptions
```

#### `GET /subscriptions/{id}`

Fetch a single subscription by ID. `404` if unknown.

```sh
curl -s localhost:8080/subscriptions/1
```

#### `PUT /subscriptions/{id}`

Update a subscription. Only fields present in the body are changed; omit a
field to leave it unchanged.

```sh
curl -s -X PUT localhost:8080/subscriptions/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enabled": false}'
```

#### `DELETE /subscriptions/{id}`

Delete a subscription and its delivery history. `204 No Content` on success.

```sh
curl -s -X DELETE localhost:8080/subscriptions/1
```

#### `GET /subscriptions/{id}/deliveries`

List delivery attempts for a subscription, newest first. Optional `?limit=`
(default 50, max configurable via `API_MAX_LIMIT`, default 500).

```sh
curl -s localhost:8080/subscriptions/1/deliveries?limit=10
```

```json
[
  {
    "id": 42,
    "subscription_id": 1,
    "event_id": "0001099511627776-0000000001",
    "status": "success",
    "response_code": 200,
    "duration_ms": 87,
    "created_at": "2026-07-24T12:01:00Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 41,
    "subscription_id": 1,
    "event_id": "0001099511627776-0000000000",
    "status": "failed",
    "response_code": 500,
    "duration_ms": 1024,
    "error": "HTTP 500",
    "created_at": "2026-07-24T12:00:55Z"
  }
]
```

#### Webhook payload

When an ingested event matches a subscription's filters, SoroTrail POSTs the
event to the subscription's URL with this body:

```json
{
  "event": {
    "id": "0001099511627776-0000000001",
    "contract_id": "CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC",
    "ledger": 256000,
    "type": "contract",
    "tx_hash": "9f5c...",
    "tx_index": 1,
    "op_index": 0,
    "in_successful_call": true,
    "topics": [{"symbol":"transfer"},{"address":"G..."},{"address":"G..."}],
    "value": {"i128":"10000000"},
    "created_at": "2026-07-24T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

Every request includes an `X-SoroTrail-Signature` header holding the
hex-encoded HMAC-SHA256 digest of the request body, keyed with the
subscription's secret. Subscribers **must verify** this signature to
confirm the payload came from SoroTrail and has not been tampered with.

**Verifying signatures — code samples:**

#### Delivery semantics

- Delivery is **at-least-once**: a subscriber may receive the same event more
  than once. Deduplicate by event `id`.
- Failed deliveries are retried up to **5 times** with exponential backoff
  (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s).
- After **5 consecutive failures** the subscription is **auto-disabled**. A
  successful delivery resets the failure counter to 0.
- Delivery attempts are recorded in `delivery_attempts` and queryable via
  `GET /subscriptions/{id}/deliveries`.
- Subscribers should return a **2xx status code** to acknowledge receipt.
  Non-2xx responses are treated as failures and retried.

### `GET /stats`

```sh
curl -s localhost:8080/stats
```

```json
{"total_events":18234,"last_ingested_ledger":260123,"verified_through_ledger":258900,"oldest_stored_ledger":242001,"chain_head_ledger":260130,"ingest_lag_ledgers":7,"contract_count":57,"watched_contracts":0,"auditor":{"passes_run":87,"ledgers_checked":1200,"findings_opened":2,"findings_repaired":1,"findings_unverifiable":0,"findings_unrecoverable":1,"rpc_requests":340}}
```

`oldest_stored_ledger` is the lowest ledger currently present in the
store. `chain_head_ledger` is read from Stellar RPC `getHealth`, and
`ingest_lag_ledgers` is `chain_head_ledger - last_ingested_ledger`. If
the RPC is temporarily unreachable, `/stats` still returns HTTP 200 with
the stored fields populated and the RPC-derived freshness fields
(`chain_head_ledger`, `ingest_lag_ledgers`) set to `null`.

`verified_through_ledger` is the inclusive highest ledger whose stored
events have been proven to match a fresh RPC fetch by the auditor. When
`AUDIT_ENABLED=false` it stays at `0`. See the Data integrity section
below for the contract the field implies.

### `GET /metrics`

Serves `http_request_duration_seconds`, a Prometheus histogram of HTTP
request latency labeled by `route` (the matched chi route pattern, e.g.
`/events/{id}` — never the raw path, so path parameters don't blow up
cardinality), `method`, and `status`.

```sh
curl -s localhost:8080/metrics | grep http_request_duration_seconds
```

Exempt from the rate limiter for the same reason `/health` is: a
Prometheus scraper polling this endpoint on its own schedule shouldn't be
throttled like a regular client.

### `GET /events/ws` (WebSocket live stream)

Pushes ingested events to the client over a single WebSocket connection
as soon as they are written to the store. There is no replay — the
stream starts at "now", and the client only sees events the indexer
ingests after it connects.

Query parameters share the same `EventFilter` shape as `GET /events`
(`contract_id`, `type`, `topic`, `from_ledger`, `to_ledger`,
`from_time`, `to_time`), so any filter that works against the query
API works against the stream.

Frame format:

- One `store.Event` per WebSocket text frame, JSON-encoded.
- Server-to-client only — clients do not send messages; the `nhooyr.io/websocket`
  library handles ping/pong internally.
- The server pings every 30s so proxies don't idle the connection.

Behavior:

- **Slow-consumer eviction**: each subscriber gets a bounded channel
  buffer (`broadcast.DefaultBufferSize` = 64). A subscriber whose
  channel fills is evicted silently: its `Events()` channel is closed,
  the handler returns, and the WebSocket is closed from the server side.
  This protects the indexer from one stuck client back-pressuring the
  broadcaster.
- **Broadcaster unwired**: returns `501 Not Implemented` (only happens
  if the binary was built without the broadcaster wired).
- **Bad filter**: returns `400 Bad Request` before the WebSocket
  upgrade, with the standard `{"error": "..."}` JSON body.

Example with [`websocat`](https://github.com/vi/websocat):

```sh
websocat 'ws://localhost:8080/events/ws?contract_id=CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC&topic=mint'
{"id":"…","contract_id":"…","topics":["mint"], …}
{"id":"…","contract_id":"…","topics":["mint"], …}
```

## Data integrity

A background auditor walks recently-ingested ledger ranges (behind the
ingest frontier, inside the RPC's retention window) and re-fetches each
range with the same filter configuration the ingester uses, comparing
the stored event counts and IDs against the fresh response. Mismatches
are logged, recorded in the `audit_findings` table, and auto-repaired
by re-ingesting the affected range with `ReplaceEventsInRange` (which
deletes orphans and updates same-ID rows so topic/value drift on the
RPC side is corrected).

Each pass advances an audit-only `verified_through_ledger` high-water
mark past the clean prefix of the audited range; that field, exposed via
`GET /stats`, is the strongest trust signal SoroTrail can offer: it
names the highest ledger whose stored events have been *verified* against
the RPC, not merely *ingested*.

Audit behaviour:

- **Filter parity**: the auditor uses the ingester's exact filter batch
  (see `Ingester.BuildFilterBatches`), so events the RPC has for
  contracts you're not watching are intentionally not checked and never
  produce false findings.
- **Idempotency**: re-running the auditor over a clean range is a no-op;
  crashes mid-repair leave the finding open so the next pass can retry.
- **Budget**: the auditor shares the request-rate budget with the
  ingester via `rpc.Budget`; `AUDIT_BUDGET_SHARE` (default 10%) caps
  the audit pool while the ingest pool gets the remainder.
- **Lag pause**: if ingest hasn't moved at least `AUDIT_LAG_THRESHOLD`
  ledgers past `verified_through_ledger`, the auditor sleeps until it
  does — it never races ingestion.
- **Retention edges**: when a finding's range ages out of the RPC's
  retention window during repair, the auditor moves the finding to
  `status='unverifiable'` instead of crashing or false-alarming.
- **Self-disagreement**: if the RPC keeps returning different events
  for the same range across repair iterations, the auditor stops after
  `AUDIT_MAX_REPAIR_ATTEMPTS` attempts and keeps the finding visible
  with `status='unrecoverable'` — operators see it via `/stats`.

Set `AUDIT_ENABLED=false` (the default) to disable the auditor entirely;
the binary's behavior is identical to a pre-audit build.

## Retention / pruning

SoroTrail exists because the RPC drops history, but “keep everything
forever” is not viable for everyone indexing busy contracts. The optional
pruner bounds on-disk growth without requiring an external cron job.

Configure **one or both** policies and the pruner runs in its own
goroutine on the same lifecycle as the ingester:

- `RETENTION_MAX_AGE` — delete events whose `created_at` is older than the
  duration (e.g. `RETENTION_MAX_AGE=2160h` keeps ~90 days).
- `RETENTION_MIN_LEDGER` — delete events **strictly below** this ledger.
  Events at exactly `RETENTION_MIN_LEDGER` are kept. The SQL is
  `ledger < bound`.

If neither is set the pruner is a no-op goroutine that returns without
deleting anything — matching the pre-pruner behaviour. Tuning knobs:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RETENTION_BATCH_SIZE` | `5000` | Rows per `DELETE` statement; smaller = less lock pressure, slower. |
| `RETENTION_PAUSE` | `100ms` | Sleep between DELETE batches so ingestion stays responsive. |
| `RETENTION_INTERVAL` | `1h` | Sleep after a sweep that found nothing to delete. |

**Safety guard.** The pruner never deletes an event whose ledger is at or
above the last ingested ledger. `RETENTION_MIN_LEDGER` is therefore an
**upper bound** on the cutoff whenever it is lower than the last ingested
ledger, so a misconfiguration above the chain head (e.g. setting
`RETENTION_MIN_LEDGER=200` when only ledger 100 has been ingested) is a
no-op rather than a destructive mistake. Pruning runs in batches of
`RETENTION_BATCH_SIZE` with a `RETENTION_PAUSE` between batches; rows are
not selected in any particular order — the safety guarantee is the
`ledger < last_ingested_ledger` predicate inside `DELETE FROM events`,
not the scan order, so the ingester is never starved for IO.

**Metrics.** `GET /stats` adds a `pruner` object when retention is
configured:

```json
{
  "total_events": 12345,
  "last_ingested_ledger": 260123,
  "..."": "...",
  "pruner": { "runs_completed": 7, "total_rows_purged": 1804321 }
}
```

`runs_completed` is the number of full sweeps; `total_rows_purged` is the
cumulative rows deleted since the process started.

**Lifecycle.** The pruner is a single background goroutine started from
`cmd/sorotrail/main.go` alongside the ingester (and, when enabled, the
auditor). On `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` every goroutine drains through a shared
error channel and the pruner exits the same way as the others — a
context-cancelled return is not an error.

**Dependent tables.** When the SEP-41 `token_events` table lands, it will
be defined with a foreign key to `events(id)` and `ON DELETE CASCADE`. The
pruner therefore deletes only from `events` and lets Postgres cascade the
dependent rows; today's single-table DELETE is correct because no such
table exists yet, and the contract is “derived tables ride along”.
## Caching

Stored events are immutable — a row written by ingest is never rewritten
in normal operation — so the API serves two distinct cache policies:

- **`GET /events/{id}`** carries a strong `ETag` equal to the event ID
  and `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`. Clients
  and CDNs can cache the response for a year without revalidating.
  Conditional requests with a matching `If-None-Match` return
  `304 Not Modified` without re-serializing the row.
- **List endpoints** (`/events`, `/contracts/{id}/events`) split on a
  moving ingest frontier: a page whose upper bound (`to_ledger`) sits
  entirely below the last-ingested ledger cannot gain new rows, so the
  response is declared immutable with a strong ETag derived from the
  filter — every filter parameter that narrows the result set, so two
  different queries can never share a validator. Pages that are
  open-ended (`to_ledger` unset) or have bounds
  at/above the frontier are still growing, so they get
  `Cache-Control: no-cache` — a deliberate "when in doubt, don't
  cache" choice rather than a guess with a short max-age.
- **`GET /health`** and **`GET /stats`** are always
  `Cache-Control: no-store` so monitoring tooling, dashboards, and
  alerting see real state rather than a stale replica.

All cacheable responses set `Vary: Accept-Encoding` so a future
compression middleware (#25) can serve distinct encoded variants
without reconciling caches that warmed on a non-encoded version.

### Retention/pruning (#8)

Immutability is conditional on the row existing. When pruning deletes an
event that was previously cached by a client or CDN, that cache will
hold a stale copy until its `max-age` expires — clients can hit the
fresh `404` immediately by sending their `If-None-Match` validator, at
which point SoroTrail's `EventExists` probe correctly returns the
not-found status. We accept this self-healing delay rather than
arbitrarily shortening the immutable max-age, because for un-deleted
rows the long `max-age` is the whole point of the cache.

### Auth'd deployments

Caching must never leak across keys. The `CACHE_PRIVATE` flag flips every
cacheable response from `Cache-Control: public` to `Cache-Control: private`
(same `max-age` and `immutable` preset), so the same build can serve shared
caches in one deployment and per-user scenarios in another. Set
`CACHE_PRIVATE=true` whenever an auth layer sits in front of the API.

Under `MULTI_TENANT=true` this is not left to configuration. Responses are
forced to `private`, `Vary` gains `Authorization` and `X-API-Key`, and the
`ETag` incorporates a digest of the caller's scope — so two tenants issuing
identical requests cannot share a cache entry, and a conditional request
carrying another tenant's validator cannot be answered `304`. The last of
those matters most: it is the only one of the three that does not need a CDN
to misbehave. See [Caching](docs/multi-tenancy.md#caching).

## Roadmap / future work

Deliberately out of scope for the MVP, with seams left for contributors:

- Per-standard event decoders (e.g. SEP-41 token transfers) on top of
  `decode.Decoder`.
- Per-contract cursors (mesh-point for the parallel sweep redesign:
  the scheduler is now parallel but still shares one cursor per
  window).
- GraphQL / websocket subscriptions.
- Metrics (Prometheus) and tracing.
- Alternative storage backends behind `store.Store`.
